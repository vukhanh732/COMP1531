## Lab 04 - Exercise - Timetable

In the Week 3 lectures you were introduced to the `date` class and objects constructed from it. Python also comes with classes for `time`, a time independent of a particular day, and `datetime`, a combination of a date and a time.

1. Open `timetable.py` and look at the documentation for the function `timetable()`.
2. Write some tests in a new file you create called `timetable_test.py`. Run the tests to see that they fail.
3. Implement `timetable()` so that the tests pass.


Note: Different systems and circumstances will mean that printing a datetime may print it as either `datetime.datetime()` or just `datetime()`. This is just a _printing_ outcome, and does not affect whether or not you will pass the tests.
