def inverse(d):
	'''
	Given a dictionary d, invert its structure such that values in d map to lists of keys in d.
	For example:
	>>> inverse({1: 'A', 2: 'B', 3: 'A'})
	{'A': [1, 3], 'B': [2]}

	Params:
		d (dict): A dictionary where all the values are hashable (i.e. can be used as keys in the
		result).

	Returns:
		(dict): A dictionary with the structure described above.
	'''
	dList = list(d.items())
	result = {}
	for key, val in dList:
		inverseList = []
		if key is None:
			pass
		for newKey, newVal in dList:
			if newVal == val:
				inverseList.append(newKey)
				result[val] = inverseList
