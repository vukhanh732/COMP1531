## Lab03 - Exercise - Wondrous (2 points)

The **Wondrous Sequence** is generated by the simple rule:

* If the current term is even, the next term is half the current term.
* If the current term is odd, the next term is three times the current term, plus 1.

For example, the sequence generated by starting with `3` is:

```txt
3 -> 10 -> 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1
```

Inside `wondrous.py` there is an implementation of this algorithm. Inside `wondrous_test.py` there is a single test for the function. The test currently fails.

Debug the program by using the `pytest` output. You can use the `-v` and `-vv` options when running `pytest` (verbose) to give you more information about the difference between your output and the expected output. Print statements are also captured in `pytest` output (`Captured stdout call` will be followed by the printed values).

There are further bugs in the function not caught by the given unit test. Find the other bugs, and write further unit tests in `wondrous_test.py` so that these bugs are picked up on.
